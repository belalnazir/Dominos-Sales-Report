# Dominos-Sales-Report
This project aims to analyze Domino's Pizza sales data with a focus on branch performance, product popularity, and the effectiveness of sales targets. The process involves collecting, cleaning, and structuring the data, followed by creating interactive visualizations in Power BI. We will assess branch performance to identify top-performing locations, analyze product popularity, and evaluate how well sales targets are being met. The analysis also includes customer segmentation, time series trends, and geospatial insights. Our goal is to deliver actionable recommendations to enhance sales and profitability. Data security is a priority, and findings will be shared with stakeholders through detailed reports and presentations.
